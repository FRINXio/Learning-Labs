# Obtain LLDP topology data


In this section we will show you how to run workflows to collect LLDP (Link Layer Discovery Protocol) information and store that information in the inventory (Elasticsearch).

The goal of this workflow is to collect LLDP information from different networking devices, reconcile that information into a single topology based on the IETF topology data model, store it and finally transform it in a dot G notation to allow for visualization.

Together with FRINX Machine, we ship sample topologies that allow you to explore our workflows without the need to provide access your own networking devices.
