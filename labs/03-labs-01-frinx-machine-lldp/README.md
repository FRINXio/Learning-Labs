## Getting LLDP topology data

In this lab you will learn how to run workflows to collect LLDP (Link Layer Discovery Protocol) information and store that information in the inventory (Elasticsearch).

The goal is to collect LLDP information from different networking devices, reconcile that information into a single topology based on the IETF topology data model, store it and finally transform it in a dot G notation to allow for visualization.

[Step 1: Obtain LLDP topology data](1.md)

[Step 2: Create a new device in the inventory](2.md)

[Step 3: Mount the devices in FRINX OpenDaylight](3.md)

[Step 4: Collect LLDP Information from Devices and Build Topology](4.md)

[Step 5: Exporting the IETF topology information in graphviz format](5.md)
