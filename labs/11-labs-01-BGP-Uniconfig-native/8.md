## Step 2: Commit the configuration

For this step select "commit" from your "Learning_Lab_part11_UNATIVE" Postman collection.

Commiting configuration sends it from your environment and odl to your device.

Press "**Send**" to execute the request.

```
POST

http://{{odl_ip}}:8181/restconf/operations/uniconfig-manager:checked-commit
```


The body of the request should look like this:

```
{
            "input": {
                "target-nodes": {
                    "node": ["R1"]
                }
            }
        }
```

Expected Status code: **200 OK**

Return message will confirm successful upload of your configuration:


```
{
    "output": {
        "overall-configuration-status": "complete",
        "node-config-results": {
            "node-config-result": [
                {
                    "nodeId": "R1",
                    "configuration-status": "complete"
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

In the next step, you will send a show request that will show you updated version of eBGP.
