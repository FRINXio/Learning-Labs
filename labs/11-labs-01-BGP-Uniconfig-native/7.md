As stated in "create BGP" step, you can edit these fields according to your needs:

In this case, however, you will be updating an already existing eBgp protocol. In this example, you will remove the "neighbor-group" argument, in case you don't need it. You will also add a second neighbor with AS number different from the first one. You can add any number of neighbors that you need. You do this by copying and editing this container:

```
{
        "neighbor-address": "192.168.1.215",
        "remote-as": {
            "as-xx": 0,
             "as-yy": "65000"
         }
    },
```

Be mindful of commas (valid JSON is necessary). Depending on whether another neighbor container comes after it, or doesn't.

Expected Status code: **201 Created**

In the next step, you will commit this configuration to your device.
