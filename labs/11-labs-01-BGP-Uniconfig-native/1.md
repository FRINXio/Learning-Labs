# FRINX OpenDaylight & UniConfig-native - eBGP

This series of labs demonstrates how to use uniconfig-native for the same configurations as in previous labs. You are still using uniconfig as you did before, but in these cases you will be using uniconfig-native. So far you have been using uniconfig-cli or uniconfig-netconf, which meant that our translation units were used to translate virtually any device vendor format to uniform configuration every time. That is not the case with uniconfig-native. It utilizes netconf with native yang language. That means that json requests that are used to communicate with devices will look differently based on the vendors of your devices. Mounting requests also differ from uniconfig-cli or uniconfig-netconf and are included in this lab's postman collection.

Important part: JSON requests used in these labs are written for IOS XRv6 devices and it is neccessary to edit them to work on different versions/vendors. Uniconfig-native can work with any device that supports netconf, but requests must be edited.

## Objectives

When you have completed this lab, you will be able to:

* Create eBGP routing protocol.
* Delete it.
* Update its properties.
* Monitor whether the protocol is running on a device or not.

### Completion Time: 30 minutes

## Prerequisites

* To make getting through this lab easier, download Postman environment and collection specifically for this lab from <a href="https://github.com/FRINXio/Postman/tree/carbon/development/learning_labs/part11">our github</a>
* This lab assumes general knowledge of using a <a href="https://developer.cisco.com/learning/modules/frinx-learning-labs">ODL and Postman</a>
* This lab assumes the reader understands what role do the routing protocols, specifically BGP, play in a working network and have worked with them before.
* Before continuing, you have to <a href="https://developer.cisco.com/learning/modules/frinx-learning-labs">mount</a> a device you want to configure.



## Step 1: Create eBGP on a Cisco IOS XRv6 device via uniconfig-native

Once you have completed all the prerequisites (see above), you can move on to creating eBGP.

In the Postman application, look at the left column and select the "Collections" tab, look up "Learning_Lab_part11_UNATIVE" where you will find all the requests needed for this lab. For this step, use "create bgp" request.

Press "**Send**" to execute the request.

```


The body of the request should look similarily to this:

```
{
    "Cisco-IOS-XR-ipv4-bgp-cfg:bgp": {
        "instance": [
            {
                "instance-name": "default",

                                "bgp-running": [

                                ],
                                "default-vrf": {

                                                    ]
                                                }
                                            ]
                                        },
                                        "neighbors": {
                                            "neighbor": [
                                                {
                                                    "neighbor-address": "192.168.1.215",
                                                    "remote-as": {
                                                        "as-xx": 0,
                                                        "as-yy": "65000"
                                                    }
                                                }
                                            ]
                                        }
                                    }
                                }
                            }
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
}
```
You can edit these fields according to your needs:

In "instance", you can edit **"as"** field, according to BGP ASN that was probabbly assigned to you by organization depending on your location when you asked for it and provided that you need to utilize eBGP. Or you can use of from the pool made for private use (64512 - 65534).

In "neighbors" you can edit all of the fields. You are also free to add more neighbors if you need to.

**"neighbor-address"** as the name suggests is the ip address of neighbor from another AS. 

**"neighbor-group-name"** is a function of BGP that allows you to group BGP neighbors that share the same outbound policies, that allows more efficient update calculations. You are free to remove it, if you don't use this function.

In "remote-as" **"as-yy"** is number of AS that is used by neighbor you are adding.


Expected Status code: **201 Created**

In the next step, you will commit this configuration to your device.
