# FRINX OpenDaylight & UniConfig-native - eBGP

This series of labs demonstrates how to use uniconfig-native for the same configurations as in previous labs. You are still using uniconfig as you did before, but in these cases, you will be using uniconfig-native. So far you have been using uniconfig-cli or uniconfig-netconf, which meant that our translation units were used to translate virtually any device vendor format to uniform configuration every time. That is not the case with uniconfig-native. It utilizes netconf with native yang language. That means that json requests that are used to communicate with devices will look different based on the vendors of your devices. Mounting requests also differ from uniconfig-cli or uniconfig-netconf and are included in this lab's postman collection.

The important part: JSON requests used in these labs are written for IOS XRv6 devices and it is necessary to edit them to work on different versions/vendors. Uniconfig-native can work with any device that supports netconf, but requests must be edited.

## Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

* Create eBGP routing protocol.
* Delete it.
* Update its properties.
* Monitor whether the protocol is running on a device or not.

### Completion Time: 30 minutes

## Prerequisites

* To make getting through this lab easier, download the Postman environment and collection that we created specifically for this lab from <a href="https://github.com/FRINXio/Postman/tree/carbon/development/learning_labs/part11">our github</a>
* This lab assumes general knowledge of using a <a href="https://developer.cisco.com/learning/modules/frinx-learning-labs">ODL and Postman</a>
* This lab assumes the reader understands what role do the routing protocols, specifically BGP, play in a working network and that the reader has some experience working with them.
* Before continuing, you have to <a href="https://developer.cisco.com/learning/modules/frinx-learning-labs">mount</a> a device you want to configure.



## Step 1: Create eBGP on a Cisco IOS XRv6 device via uniconfig-native

Once you have completed all the prerequisites (see above), you can move on to creating eBGP.

In the Postman application, look at the left column and select the "Collections" tab, look up "Learning_Lab_part11_UNATIVE" where you will find all the requests needed for this lab. For this step, use the "create bgp" request.

Press "**Send**" to execute the request.

```


The body of the request should look similar to this:

```
{
    "Cisco-IOS-XR-ipv4-bgp-cfg:bgp": {
        "instance": [
            {
                "instance-name": "default",

                                "bgp-running": [

                                ],
                                "default-vrf": {

                                                }
                                            ]
                                        },
                                        "neighbors": {
                                            "neighbor": [
                                                {
                                                    "neighbor-address": "192.168.1.215",
                                                    "remote-as": {
                                                        "as-xx": 0,
                                                        "as-yy": "65000"
                                                    }
                                                }
                                            ]
                                        }
                                    }
                                }
                            }
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
}
```
You can edit these fields according to your needs:

In "instance", you can edit the **"as"** field, according to BGP ASN that was probabbly assigned to you by organization depending on your location when you asked for it and provided that you need to utilize eBGP. Or you can make use of  the pool made for private use (64512 - 65534).

In "neighbors" you can edit all of the fields. You are also free to add more neighbors if you need to.

**"neighbor-address"** as the name suggests is the IP address of neighbor from another AS. 

**"neighbor-group-name"** is a function of BGP that allows you to group BGP neighbors that share the same outbound policies. This allows more efficient update calculations. You are free to remove it if you don't use this function.

In "remote-as" **"as-yy"** is the AS number that is used by the neighbor you are adding.


Expected Status code: **201 Created**

In the next step, you will commit this configuration to your device.
