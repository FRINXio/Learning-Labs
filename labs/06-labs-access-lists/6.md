[>>> Head back to step 1: Delete access list on a Cisco IOS XRV device via CLI <<<](5.md) 

## Step 2: Sync from network

In the previous step, you have created an access list on your device and commited the change. Now, you will update information in your ODL config database from device, so you can validate successful creation of access list in next steps.

In step 2 and step 3 it does not matter wheter you are working on a ipv4 or ipv6 access list, configuration stays the same.

In the Postman application, in the "Collections" tab, you will find "sync-from-network" POST request right under the "Create ipv4 acces-list" that we used in previous step.

Press "**Send**" to execute request.


```
POST

http://{{odl_ip}}:8181/restconf/operations/uniconfig-manager:sync-from-network
```

The body of the request should look similar to the following:

```
{
	"input": {
				"target-nodes": {
		}

	}
}
```

Expected Status code: **200 Created**

In the next step, you will replace config with operational config from ODL.
