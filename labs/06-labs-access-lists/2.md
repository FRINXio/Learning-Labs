[>>> Head back to step 1: Create access list on a Cisco IOS XRV device via CLI <<<](1.md) 

## Step 2: Sync from network

In the previous step, you have created an access list on your device and commited the change. Now, we will update information from device, so we can validate successful creation of access list in next steps.

In the Postman application, in the "Collections" tab, you will find "sync-from-network" POST request right under the "Create ipv4 acces-list" that we used in previous step.

Press "**Send**" to execute request.



```
POST

http://{{odl_ip}}:8181/restconf/operations/uniconfig-manager:replace-config-with-operational
```


The body of the request should look similar to the following:

```
{
	"input": {
				"target-nodes": {
		}

	}
}
```

Expected Status code: **200 Created**

In the next step, we will replace config with operational.
