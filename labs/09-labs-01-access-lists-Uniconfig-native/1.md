# FRINX OpenDaylight & UniConfig-native - Access Lists

This series of labs demonstrates how to use uniconfig-native for the same configurations as in previous labs. You are still using uniconfig as you did before, but in these cases, you will be using uniconfig-native. So far you have been using uniconfig-cli or uniconfig-netconf, which meant that our translation units were used to translate virtually any device vendor format to uniform configuration every time. That is not the case with uniconfig-native. It utilizes netconf with native yang language. That means that json requests that are used to communicate with devices will look different based on the vendors of your devices. Mounting requests also differ from uniconfig-cli or uniconfig-netconf and are included in this lab's postman collection.

The important part: JSON requests used in these labs are written for IOS XRv6 devices and it is necessary to edit them to work on different versions/vendors. Uniconfig-native can work with any device that supports netconf, but requests must be edited.

## Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

* Create an IPV4 and IPV6 access lists.
* Delete these lists.
* Place them on an interface of your device.
* Validate success of every step along the way.

### Completion Time: 60 minutes

## Prerequisites

* To make getting through this lab easier, download the Postman environment and collection that we created specifically for this lab from <a href="https://github.com/FRINXio/Postman/tree/carbon/development/learning_labs/part9">our github</a>
* This lab assumes general knowledge of using <a href="https://frinxio.github.io/Learning-Labs/labs/01-labs-01-odl-uniconfig-first-steps/">ODL and Postman</a>
* This lab assumes the reader understands what role do the routing protocols play in a working network and that the user has some experience with them.
* Before continuing, you have to <a href="https://frinxio.github.io/Learning-Labs/labs/01-labs-01-odl-uniconfig-first-steps/">mount</a> a device you want to configure.




## Step 1: Create access list on a Cisco IOS XRv6 device via uniconfig-native

Once you have completed all prerequisites (see above), you'll begin with creating an access list in ODL.

This lab is made for IOS XRv6 devices, so make sure your device matches.

In the Postman application, look at the left column and select the "Collections" tab. Look up "Learning_Lab_part9_UNATIVE" and use the "create ipv4 access list" request.

Press "**Send**" to execute the request.



```
PUT

http://{{odl_ip}}:8181/restconf/config/network-topology:network-topology/topology/uniconfig/node/R1/frinx-uniconfig-topology:configuration/Cisco-IOS-XR-ipv4-acl-cfg:ipv4-acl-and-prefix-list
```


The body of the request will look different based on rules you want to use in the access list and your postman environment, this is just an example:

```
{
    "Cisco-IOS-XR-ipv4-acl-cfg:ipv4-acl-and-prefix-list": {
        "accesses": {
            "access": [
                {
                    "access-list-name": "inacl1",
                    "access-list-entries": {
                        "access-list-entry": [
                            {
                                "sequence-number": 10,
                                "sequence-str": "10",
                                "grant": "deny",
                                "destination-network": {
                                    "destination-wild-card-bits": "0.0.0.255",
                                    "destination-address": "192.168.1.214"
                                },
                                "source-network": {
                                    "source-address": "192.168.1.215",
                                    "source-wild-card-bits": "0.0.0.255"
                                }
                            }
                        ]
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```
The access list is written the same way as if you were connected to a device and using cli. You can name the access list however you want, using the numbered or named way. You can add as many rules as you want. You can make it either a standard or an extended access list, depending on your needs. The **"grant"** value decides whether the access list is of **deny** or **permit** type.

### Creating ipv6 access list works very similarly
The only difference is that you choose the "create ipv6 access list" request in your postman environment. The PUT request should look like this:


```
PUT

http://{{odl_ip}}:8181/restconf/config/network-topology:network-topology/topology/uniconfig/node/R1/frinx-uniconfig-topology:configuration/Cisco-IOS-XR-ipv6-acl-cfg:ipv6-acl-and-prefix-list
```
Press "**Send**" to execute request.

The body of the request will look different based on rules you want to use in the access list and your postman environment, this is just an example:
```
{
    "Cisco-IOS-XR-ipv6-acl-cfg:ipv6-acl-and-prefix-list": {
        "accesses": {
            "access": [
                {
                    "name": "inacl2",
                    "access-list-entries": {
                        "access-list-entry": [
                            {
                                "sequence-number": 2,
                                "source-network": {
                                    "source-address": "2001:db8:abcd:12::",
                                    "source-wild-card-bits": 64
                                },
                                "destination-network": {
                                    "destination-wild-card-bits": 64,
                                    "destination-address": "2001:db8:abcd:12::"
                                },
                                "grant": "deny",
                                "sequence-str": "2"
                            }
                        ]
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

Expected Status code: **201 Created**

In the next step, you will commit configuration to the device.
