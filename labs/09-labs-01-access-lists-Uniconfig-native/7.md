## Step 1: Create ingress/egress on a Cisco IOS XRv6 device via uniconfig-native

Now use the "create access list ingress/egress" PUT request.


Press "**Send**" to execute the request.

```
PUT

http://{{odl_ip}}:8181/restconf/config/network-topology:network-topology/topology/uniconfig/node/R1/frinx-uniconfig-topology:configuration/Cisco-IOS-XR-ifmgr-cfg:interface-configurations/interface-configuration/act/GigabitEthernet0%2F0%2F0%2F0
```


The body of the request should look similar to the following:

```
{
    "Cisco-IOS-XR-ifmgr-cfg:interface-configurations": {
        "interface-configuration": [
                        {
                "active": "act",
                "interface-name": "GigabitEthernet0%2F0%2F0%2F0",
                "shutdown": [
                    null
                ],
                "Cisco-IOS-XR-ip-pfilter-cfg:ipv4-packet-filter": {
                    "inbound": {
                        "acl-name-array": [
                            "inacl1"
                        ],
                        "is-common-array": [
                            false
                        ]
                    },
                    "outbound": {
                        "acl-name-array": [
                            "inacl1"
                        ],
                        "is-common-array": [
                            false
                        ]
                    }
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
```
