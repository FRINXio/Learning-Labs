## Step 3: Show ipv4/ipv6 access list

Now that your configuration is committed, you can show the access list that you created before, validating its creation. Find "show ipv4 acces list" or "show ipv6 access list"


Press "**Send**" to execute the request.


```
GET

http://{{odl_ip}}:8181/restconf/config/network-topology:network-topology/topology/uniconfig/node/R1/frinx-uniconfig-topology:configuration/Cisco-IOS-XR-ipv4-acl-cfg:ipv4-acl-and-prefix-list
```

OR ipv6 version

```
GET

http://{{odl_ip}}:8181/restconf/config/network-topology:network-topology/topology/uniconfig/node/R1/frinx-uniconfig-topology:configuration/Cisco-IOS-XR-ipv6-acl-cfg:ipv6-acl-and-prefix-list
```

As a response, you will get all the details that you put in the access list before. Something similar to this:

```
{
    "Cisco-IOS-XR-ipv4-acl-cfg:ipv4-acl-and-prefix-list": {
        "accesses": {
            "access": [
                {
                    "access-list-name": "inacl1",
                    "access-list-entries": {
                        "access-list-entry": [
                            {
                                "sequence-number": 10,
                                "sequence-str": "10",
                                "grant": "deny",
                                "destination-network": {
                                    "destination-wild-card-bits": "0.0.0.255",
                                    "destination-address": "192.168.1.214"
                                },
                                "source-network": {
                                    "source-address": "192.168.1.215",
                                    "source-wild-card-bits": "0.0.0.255"
                                }
                            }
                        ]
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```
