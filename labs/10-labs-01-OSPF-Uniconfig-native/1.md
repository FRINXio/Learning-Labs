# FRINX OpenDaylight & UniConfig-native - OSPF

This series of labs demonstrates how to use uniconfig-native for the same configurations as in previous labs. You are still using uniconfig as you did before, but in these cases you will be using uniconfig-native. So far you have been using uniconfig-cli or uniconfig-netconf, which meant that our translation units were used to translate virtually any device vendor format to uniform configuration every time. That is not the case with uniconfig-native. It utilizes netconf with native yang language. That means that json requests that are used to communicate with devices will look differently based on the vendors of your devices. Mounting requests also differ from uniconfig-cli or uniconfig-netconf and are included in this lab's postman collection.

Important part: JSON requests used in these labs are written for IOS XRv6 devices and it is neccessary to edit them to work on different versions/vendors. Uniconfig-native can work with any device that supports netconf, but requests must be edited.

## Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

* Create OSPF routing process.
* Delete it.

### Completion Time: 30 minutes

## Prerequisites

* To make getting through this lab easier, download the Postman environment and collection that we created specifically for this lab from <a href="https://github.com/FRINXio/Postman/tree/carbon/development/learning_labs/part10">our github</a>
* This lab assumes general knowledge of using a <a href="https://frinxio.github.io/Learning-Labs/labs/01-labs-01-odl-uniconfig-first-steps/">ODL and Postman</a>
* This lab assumes the reader understands what role do the routing protocols, specifically OSPF, play in a working network and that reader has some experience working with them.
* Before continuing, you have to <a href="https://frinxio.github.io/Learning-Labs/labs/01-labs-01-odl-uniconfig-first-steps/">mount</a> a device you want to configure.


## Step 1: Create OSPF process on a Cisco IOS XRv6 device via CLI

Once you have completed all prerequisites (see above), you can set-up the OSPF.

This lab is made for IOS XRv6 devices, so make sure your device matches.

In the Postman application, look at the left column and select the "Collections" tab, look up "Learning_Lab_part10_UNATIVE" where you will find all the requests needed for this lab. For this step, use "create ospf" request.

Press "**Send**" to execute the request.

```
PUT

http://{{odl_ip}}:8181/restconf/config/network-topology:network-topology/topology/uniconfig/node/R1/frinx-uniconfig-topology:configuration/Cisco-IOS-XR-ipv4-ospf-cfg:ospf
```


The body of the request will look differently based on your interface, process id, areas, this is just an example:

```
{
    "Cisco-IOS-XR-ipv4-ospf-cfg:ospf": {
        "processes": {
            "process": [
                {
                    "process-name": "97",
                    "start": [
                        null
                    ],
                    "default-vrf": {
                        "max-metric": {
                            "max-metric-on-startup": {
                                "include-stub": true,
                                "summary-lsa": true,
                                "startup-max": 60,
                                "external-lsa": true,
                                "wait-for-bgp": false
                            }
                        },
                        "area-addresses": {
                            "area-area-id": [
                                {
                                    "area-id": 1,
                                    "name-scopes": {
                                        "name-scope": [
                                            {
                                                "interface-name": "Loopback97",
                                                "running": [
                                                    null
                                                ],
                                                "cost": 77
                                            }
                                        ]
                                    },
                                    "running": [
                                        null
                                    ]
                                }
                            ]
                        }
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

To help you understand structure better and know which parameter to change to achieve desired configuration of OSPF process:

Code is structured to differentiate between individual arguments.

You begin with this:

```
"process": [
    {
        "process-name": "97",
        "start": [
            null
        ],
```
**"process-name"** changes the number of ospf process, you are free to change this to your liking.
    Equivalent to **ROUTER(config)#router ospf 97**

Next part is:

```
"default-vrf": {
                        "max-metric": {
                            "max-metric-on-startup": {
                                "include-stub": true,
                                "summary-lsa": true,
                                "startup-max": 60,
                                "external-lsa": true,
                                "wait-for-bgp": false
                            }
                        },
```

You can edit everything in this part, according to your needs.


```
"area-addresses": {
                            "area-area-id": [
                                {
                                    "area-id": 1,
                                    "name-scopes": {
                                        "name-scope": [
                                            {
                                                "interface-name": "Loopback97",
                                                "running": [
                                                    null
                                                ],
                                                "cost": 77
                                            }
                                        ]
                                    },
```

This part is fully up to you. 

**"area-id"** determines area number used in OSPF process.

**"interface-name"** affects which interface will be included in OSPF process.

**"cost"** can be adjusted to your need and results in change of cost of the route.

Expected Status code: **201 Created**

In the next step, you will commit configuration to the device.
