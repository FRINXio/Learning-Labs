# Obtain platform inventory data

In this section we show how users can execute workflows to obtain platform inventory data from devices in the network and to store them in the inventory (Elasticsearch).

The goal of this use case is to collect inventory information about physical devices via their vendor specific NETCONF or CLI interfaces, convert this information into OpenConfig data structures and store the resulting information as a child entry to its associated parent in Elasticsearch. 

The outcome is that users can manage their physical network inventory (line cards, route processors, modules, transceivers, etc â€¦) across different hardware vendors in real-time via a single uniform interface.
