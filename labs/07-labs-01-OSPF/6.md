## Step 3: Show OSPF process

For this step select "show ospf" from your "Learning_lab_part7" Postman collection.

Press "**Send**" to execute the request.

```
GET

http://{{odl_ip}}:8181/rests/data/network-topology:network-topology/topology=uniconfig/node=R1/frinx-uniconfig-topology:configuration/frinx-openconfig-network-instance:network-instances/network-instance=default/protocols/protocol=frinx-openconfig-policy-types%3AOSPF,97
```

As you deleted OSPF process in previous steps, the response you will get will be a "404 Not Found" status code, which confirms the removal of the process.

Expected Status code: **404 Not Found**

**Congratulations!** <br>
You have removed OSPF using **FRINX OpenDaylight & UniConfig** and finished this lab.
