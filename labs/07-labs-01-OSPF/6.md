## Step 2: Dry run commit

For this step select "dry run" from your "Learning_lab_part7" Postman collection.

Press "**Send**" to execute the request.

```
POST

http://{{odl_ip}}:8181/restconf/operations/dryrun-manager:dryrun-commit
```


The body of the request should look like this:

```
{
    "input": {
        "target-nodes": {
            "node": [
                "xr5"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

Dry run is optional.

As in previous dry commits, you will get response that shows summary of configuration that will be send to the device, this time removing ospf process:

```
"output": {
        "overall-configuration-status": "complete",
        "node-config-results": {
            "node-config-result": [
                {
                    "nodeId": "xr5",
                    "configuration": "2019-08-16T10:13:39.291: configure terminal\n2019-08-16T10:13:39.292: router ospf 97 \narea 1\nno interface Loopback97\nroot\n\n2019-08-16T10:13:39.292: router ospf 97 \nno area 1\nroot\n\n2019-08-16T10:13:39.293: router ospf 97 \nno max-metric router-lsa on-startup 60 external-lsa include-stub summary-lsa \nroot\n\n2019-08-16T10:13:39.293: no router ospf 97 \n\n2019-08-16T10:13:39.297: commit\n2019-08-16T10:13:39.297: end\n",
                    "configuration-status": "complete"
                },
```
