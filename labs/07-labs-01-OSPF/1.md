# FRINX OpenDaylight & UniConfig - OSPF

In this lab, you will learn how to create and remove OSPF routing protocol on XR5 cisco devices using FRINX OpenDaylight (ODL) with UniConfig.

## Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

* Create an OSPF routing process.
* Delete this process.
* Monitor whether the process is running on a device or not.

### Completion Time: 30 minutes

## Prerequisites

* To make getting through this lab easier, download the Postman environment and collection that we created specifically for this lab from <a href="https://github.com/FRINXio/Postman/tree/carbon/development/learning_labs/part7">our github</a>
* This lab assumes general knowledge of using <a href="https://frinxio.github.io/Learning-Labs/labs/01-labs-01-odl-uniconfig-first-steps/">ODL and Postman</a>
* This lab assumes the reader understands what role do the routing protocols play in a working network and that the user has some experience with them.
* Before continuing, you have to <a href="https://frinxio.github.io/Learning-Labs/labs/01-labs-01-odl-uniconfig-first-steps/">mount</a> a device you want to configure.
* Additional requests that are optional for this lab can be found <a href="https://frinxio.github.io/Learning-Labs/labs/01-labs-01-odl-uniconfig-first-steps/">here.</a>


## Step 1: Create an OSPF process on a Cisco IOS XRV device via CLI

Once you have completed all prerequisites (see above), you can set-up the OSPF.

This lab is made for IOS XRV5 devices, so make sure your device matches.

In the Postman application, look at the left column and select the "Collections" tab, look up "Learning_Lab_part7" where you will find all the requests needed for this lab. For this step, use the "create ospf" request.

Press "**Send**" to execute the request.

```

http://{{odl_ip}}:8181/restconf/config/network-topology:network-topology/topology/uniconfig/node/xr5/frinx-uniconfig-topology:configuration/frinx-openconfig-network-instance:network-instances/network-instance/default/protocols/protocol/frinx-openconfig-policy-types:OSPF/97
```


The body of the request will look different based on your interface, process id, areas, this is just an example:

```

                                        ]
                                    }
                                }
                            ]
                        }

                    "area": [
                        {
                            "identifier": 1,
                            "config": {
                                "identifier": 1
                            },
                            "interfaces": {
                                "interface": [
                                    {
                                        "id": "Loopback97",
                                        "config": {
                                            "metric": 77,
                                            "id": "Loopback97"
                                        }
                                    }
                                ]
                            }
                        }
                    ]
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

To help you understand the structure better so that you know which parameter to change to achieve the desired configuration of the OSPF process, the code is structured to differentiate between individual arguments.

You begin with this:

```
            "name": 97,
            "identifier": "frinx-openconfig-policy-types:OSPF",
            "config": {
                "name": 97,
                "identifier": "frinx-openconfig-policy-types:OSPF"
            },
```

**"name"** - Changes the number of the ospf process. You are free to change this to your liking.
    Equivalent to **ROUTER(config)#router ospf 97**

**"identifier"** - Determines which protocol you are using, so in this case, when configuring OSPF, do not change this.

The next part is:

```
"max-metric-timer": [
                                {
                                    "trigger": "frinx-openconfig-ospf-types:MAX_METRIC_ON_SYSTEM_BOOT",
                                    "config": {
                                        "trigger": "frinx-openconfig-ospf-types:MAX_METRIC_ON_SYSTEM_BOOT",
                                        "timeout": 60,
                                        "include": [ 
                                            "frinx-openconfig-ospf-types:MAX_METRIC_INCLUDE_STUB", 
                                            "frinx-openconfig-ospf-types:MAX_METRIC_INCLUDE_TYPE2_EXTERNAL",
                                            "frinx-cisco-ospf-extension:MAX_METRIC_SUMMARY_LSA"
                                        ]
                                    }
                                }
                            ]
```

This comes handy when you want to keep the device as a valid path in OSPF routing, but want to keep it from being chosen as the best path. In such case, you set the max metric for a given time after boot of the device to x seconds. You are free to change the time you want to use or delete it if you don't want to use these features of OSPF.

```
"areas": {
                    "area": [
                        {
                            "identifier":1,
                            "config": {
                                "identifier": 1
                            },
                            "interfaces": {
                                "interface": [
                                    {
                                        "id": "Loopback97",
                                        "config": {
                                            "metric": 77,
                                            "id": "Loopback97"
```

This part is fully up to you. 

**"identifier"** - Both in "area" and in "config" determines the area number used in the OSPF process.

**"metric"** - Can be adjusted to your needs and results in a change of cost of the route.

**"id"** - Both in "interfaces" and in "config" affects which interface will be included in the OSPF process.

Expected Status code: **201 Created**

In the next step, you will commit the configuration to the device.
