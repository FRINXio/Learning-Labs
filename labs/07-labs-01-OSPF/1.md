# FRINX OpenDaylight & UniConfig - OSPF

In this lab, you will learn to create and remove OSPF routing protocol on XR5 cisco devices using FRINX OpenDaylight (ODL) with UniConfig.

## Objectives

When you have completed this lab, you will be able to:

* Create OSPF routing process.
* Delete it.
* Monitor whether the process is running on a device or not.

### Completion Time: 30 minutes

## Prerequisites

* To make getting through this lab easier, download Postman environment collection specifically for this lab from <a href="https://github.com/FRINXio/Postman/tree/carbon/development/learning_labs/part7">our github</a>
* This lab assumes general knowledge of using a <a href="https://developer.cisco.com/learning/modules/frinx-learning-labs">ODL and Postman</a>
* This lab assumes the reader understands what role do the routing protocols play in a working network and have worked with them before.
* Before continuing, you have to <a href="https://developer.cisco.com/learning/modules/frinx-learning-labs">mount</a> a device you want to configure.



## Step 1: Create OSPF process on a Cisco IOS XRV device via CLI

Once you have completed all prerequisites (see above), you can set-up the OSPF.

This lab is made for IOS XRV5 devices, so make sure your device matches.

In the Postman application, look at the left column and select the "Collections" tab, look up "Learning_Lab_part7" where you will find all the requests needed for this lab. For this step, use "create ospf" request.

Press "**Send**" to execute the request.

```
PUT

http://{{odl_ip}}:8181/restconf/config/network-topology:network-topology/topology/uniconfig/node/xr5/frinx-uniconfig-topology:configuration/frinx-openconfig-network-instance:network-instances/network-instance/default/protocols/protocol/frinx-openconfig-policy-types:OSPF/97
```


The body of the request will look differently based on your interface, process id, areas, this is just an example:

```

                                        ]

                                    }

                                }

                            ]

                        }

                            "config": {

                                "identifier": 1

                                    {

                                        "id": "Loopback97",

                                        "config": {

                                            "metric": 77,
                                            "id": "Loopback97"

                                        }

                                    }

                                ]

                            }

                        }

                    ]

                }

            }

        }

    ]

}
```

To help you understand structure better and know which parameter to change to achieve desired configuration of OSPF process:

Code is structured to differentiate between individual arguments.

You begin with this:

```
            "name": 97,

            "identifier": "frinx-openconfig-policy-types:OSPF",

            "config": {

                "name": 97,

                "identifier": "frinx-openconfig-policy-types:OSPF"

            },
```
**"name"** changes the number of ospf process, you are free to change this to your liking.
    Equivalent to **ROUTER(config)#router ospf 97**

**"identifier"** however determines which protocol you are using, so in this case, configuring OSPF, you do not want to change this.

Next part is:

```
"max-metric-timer": [

                                {

                                    "trigger": "frinx-openconfig-ospf-types:MAX_METRIC_ON_SYSTEM_BOOT",

                                    "config": {

                                        "trigger": "frinx-openconfig-ospf-types:MAX_METRIC_ON_SYSTEM_BOOT",

                                        "timeout": 60,

                                        "include": [ 

                                            "frinx-openconfig-ospf-types:MAX_METRIC_INCLUDE_STUB", 

                                            "frinx-openconfig-ospf-types:MAX_METRIC_INCLUDE_TYPE2_EXTERNAL",

                                            "frinx-cisco-ospf-extension:MAX_METRIC_SUMMARY_LSA"

                                        ]

                                    }

                                }

                            ]
```

This comes handy when you want to keep device as a valid path in OSPF routing, but want to keep it from being chosen as best path, so you set it for max metric for a given time after boot of device for x seconds. You are free to change the time you want to use, or if you want to use these features of OSPF.


```
"areas": {

                    "area": [

                        {

                            "identifier":1,

                            "config": {

                                "identifier": 1

                            },

                            "interfaces": {

                                "interface": [

                                    {

                                        "id": "Loopback97",

                                        "config": {

                                            "metric": 77,
                                            "id": "Loopback97"
```

This part is fully up to you. 

**"identifier"** both in "area" and in "config" determines area number used in OSPF process.

**"metric"** can be adjusted to your need and results in change of cost of the route.

**"id"** both in "interfaces" and in "config" affects which interface will be included in OSPF process.





Expected Status code: **201 Created**

In the next step, you will send a dry run commit to make sure your OSPF configuration is correct.
