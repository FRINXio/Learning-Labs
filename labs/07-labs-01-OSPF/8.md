## Step 6: Show OSPF process

For this step select "show ospf" from your "Learning_lab_part7" Postman collection.

Press "**Send**" to execute the request.

```
GET

http://{{odl_ip}}:8181/restconf/operational/network-topology:network-topology/topology/uniconfig/node/xr5/frinx-uniconfig-topology:configuration/frinx-openconfig-network-instance:network-instances/network-instance/default/protocols/protocol/frinx-openconfig-policy-types:OSPF/97
```

As you deleted ospf process in previous steps, you will not get a response back, you will get "404 Not Found" status code, confirming removal of the process.

Expected Status code: **404 Not Found**

**Congratulations!** <br>
You have removed OSPF using **FRINX OpenDaylight & UniConfig** and finished this lab.
