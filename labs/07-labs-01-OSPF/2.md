## Step 2: Commit the configuration

For this step select "commit" from your "Learning_lab_part7" Postman collection.

Committing configuration sends it from your environment and odl to your device.

Press "**Send**" to execute the request.

```
POST

http://{{odl_ip}}:8181/rests/operations/uniconfig-manager:commit
```


The body of the request should look like this:

```
{
    "input": {
        "target-nodes": {
            "node": [
                "R1"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

Expected Status code: **200 OK**

The return message will confirm successful upload of your configuration:


```
{
    "output": {
        "node-results": {
            "node-result": [
                {
                    "node-id": "R1",
                    "configuration-status": "complete"
                }
            ]
        },
        "overall-status": "complete"
    }
}
```

In the next step, you will send a request that will show your configuration.
