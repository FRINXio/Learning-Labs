## Step 2: Commit the configuration

For this step select "commit" from your "Learning_lab_part7" Postman collection.

Press "**Send**" to execute the request.

```
POST

http://{{odl_ip}}:8181/restconf/operations/uniconfig-manager:commit
```


The body of the request should look like this:

```
{
    "input": {
        "target-nodes": {
            "node": [
                "xr5"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

Expected Status code: **200 OK**

Commit response will let you know whether the configuration upload was successful:

```
{
    "output": {
        "overall-configuration-status": "complete",
        "node-config-results": {
            "node-config-result": [
                {
                    "node-id": "xr5",
                    "configuration-status": "complete"
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

In the next step, you will send a request that will show your config.
