## Step 4: Sync from network

For this step select "sync from network" from your "Learning_lab_part7" Postman collection.

It is not necessary to send "Sync from network" and "Replace config with operational" every time, but it is good practice to send it before sending "show" commands, in case that configuration on your device was manually changed after last sync.

Press "**Send**" to execute the request.

```
POST

http://{{odl_ip}}:8181/restconf/operations/uniconfig-manager:sync-from-network
```


The body of the request should look like this:

```
{
    "input": {
        "target-nodes": {
            "node": [
                "{{node_id}}"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

Expected Status code: **200 OK**

In the next step, you will replace config with operational.
