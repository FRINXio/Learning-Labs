## Calculate diff

This request also works with the databases of ODL, but its use is a bit different, mainly for testing. It shows the differences between the "Config" database and the "Operational" database.

Example: Imagine that, as stated before, someone changes some configuration of a device using traditional CLI without your knowledge. You could just send "sync from network" and "replace config with operational" and be all synced-up. But maybe you want to know exactly what was changed in device's configuration. That is what this request does. You use only "sync from network", so configuration of the device is in ODL, but only in "Operational" database. Then you send "calculate diff" request which compares 2 databases within the ODL - "Config" and "Operational" and shows you differences between them. That way you will know specifically which parts of device's configuration were changed.



Press "**Send**" to execute request.

```
POST
http://localhost:8181/restconf/operations/uniconfig-manager:calculate-diff
```

Body should look like this:

```
{
    "input": {
        "target-nodes": {
            "node": [
                "xe"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```
The response will show you differences within ODL. In this case we expected empty device configuration but the returned example shows that there is already BGP configured on the device. It shows only the parts of the configuration that are different.
