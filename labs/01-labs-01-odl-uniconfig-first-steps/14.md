## Dry run commit

You might already be familiar with this one. It works just like the usual "commit", only it's a simulated version. That way you see what you are committing in case you want to 100% sure. After that, if your configuration passes, you can use the real commit.


Press "**Send**" to execute request.

            ]
        }
    }
