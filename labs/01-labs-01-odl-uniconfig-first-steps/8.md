# Step 7: Unmount device

The unmounting procedure uses the same request URI as mounting does, but with the "DELETE" method instead of the "PUT" method.

In the left column select "Collections" tab, click on "sample XE collection" and find the "Unmount IOS XE" DELETE request.

Press "**Send**" to execute request.

```
DELETE

http://{{odl_ip}}:8181/rests/data/network-topology:network-topology/topology=cli/node=cli-10000
```

The response body of the output is empty. The confirmation of successful unmounting of the device can be seen in the status code.

Expected status code: **200 OK**
