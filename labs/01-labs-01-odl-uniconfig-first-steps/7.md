# Step 7: Execute & Read API call to show interface counters details

In the previous examples we have used OpenConfig semantics to configure and read from our network device. In this section we will show you how you can send and read native commands to and from your network device. In the following example, we use "GigabitEthernet1". Make sure you edit the interface name to match an actual interface on your device.

In the left column select the "Collections" tab, click on "sample XE collection" and find the "show interfaces GigabitEthernet1" POST request.

Press "**Send**" to execute request.

Request:

```
POST
http://{{odl_ip}}:8181/restconf/operations/network-topology:network-topology/topology/{{topology_id_cli}}/node/{{node_id}}/yang-ext:mount/cli-unit-generic:execute-and-read
```

The body of the request looks as follows:

```
{
  "input" :
  {
     "ios-cli:command" : "sh interfaces GigabitEthernet1 controller"
  }
}

```

Typical output reads as follows. This outcome is an example, it may not reflect the state of your current configuration:

```
{
    "output": {
        "output": "GigabitEthernet1 is up, line protocol is up \r\n  Hardware is CSR vNIC, address is a25f.1587.f0e7 (bia a25f.1587.f0e7)\r\n  Internet address is 192.168.1.253/24\r\n  MTU 1500 bytes, BW 1000000 Kbit/sec, DLY 10 usec, \r\n     reliability 255/255, txload 1/255, rxload 1/255\r\n  Encapsulation ARPA, loopback not set\r\n  Keepalive set (10 sec)\r\n  Auto Duplex, Auto Speed, link type is auto, media type is RJ45\r\n  output flow-control is unsupported, input flow-control is unsupported\r\n  ARP type: ARPA, ARP Timeout 04:00:00\r\n  Last input 00:00:07, output 00:00:52, output hang never\r\n  Last clearing of \"show interface\" counters never\r\n  Input queue: 0/375/0/0 (size/max/drops/flushes); Total output drops: 0\r\n  Queueing strategy: fifo\r\n  Output queue: 0/40 (size/max)\r\n  5 minute input rate 0 bits/sec, 0 packets/sec\r\n  5 minute output rate 0 bits/sec, 0 packets/sec\r\n     436167 packets input, 72445274 bytes, 0 no buffer\r\n     Received 0 broadcasts (0 IP multicasts)\r\n     0 runts, 0 giants, 0 throttles \r\n     0 input errors, 0 CRC, 0 frame, 0 overrun, 0 ignored\r\n     0 watchdog, 0 multicast, 0 pause input\r\n     1339 packets output, 150802 bytes, 0 underruns\r\n     0 output errors, 0 collisions, 1 interface resets\r\n     68187 unknown protocol drops\r\n     0 babbles, 0 late collision, 0 deferred\r\n     0 lost carrier, 0 no carrier, 0 pause output\r\n     0 output buffer failures, 0 output buffers swapped out"
    }
}

```

Expected status code for both requests: **200 OK**

Output is returned in json format which requires escaping. You need to unescape the text to retrieve the original formatting. (e.g. [https://www.freeformatter.com/json-escape.html](https://www.freeformatter.com/json-escape.html))
