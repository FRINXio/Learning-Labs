# CLL: FRINX OpenDaylight & UniConfig - Optional requests

These few next requests are optional and needed only in specific situations while configuring a device. All of them will be explained in this lab and you can come back to them if you ever need them. They will not be listed in next labs.

## Sync from network

This request can be useful if you change something in device's configuration manually and not using ODL. ODL contains 2 databases. "Config" and "Operational". "Sync from network" replaces "Operational" config with actual state of the device. "Operational" then contains latest state of the device, until you change configuration of the device manually with cli again. If you use "commit" request using ODL, all your databases are synced with device, so "sync from network" and "replace config with operational" are not needed in that case.

Press "**Send**" to execute request.

```
POST
http://{{odl_ip}}:8181/restconf/operations/uniconfig-manager:sync-from-network
```

Body should look like this:

```
{
    "input": {
        "target-nodes": {
            "node": [
                "xr5"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```
Now, your "Operational" and actual device are synced.

Expected status code: **200 OK**
