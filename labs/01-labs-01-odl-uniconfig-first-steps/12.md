## Replace config with operational

This request works similarly as previous, only it synces 2 databases within ODL. It replaces your intended configuration - "config" with operational. With these 2 requests you can manually sync your ODL and actual state of the device in case its configuraion was changed manually.

Press "**Send**" to execute request.

```
POST
http://{{odl_ip}}:8181/restconf/operations/uniconfig-manager:replace-config-with-operational
```

Body should look like this:

```
{
    "input": {
        "target-nodes": {
            "node": [
                "{{node_id}}"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```
Now, your "Config" and "Operational" are both synced with actual state of the device.

Expected status code: **200 OK**
