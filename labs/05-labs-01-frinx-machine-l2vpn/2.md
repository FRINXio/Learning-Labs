# Running the L2VPN workflow



In `Home --> Workflows --> Definitions` search for the workflow called **Create_L2VPN_P2P_OC_uniconfig**. A pre-filled modal should pop up.
The parameters should be as follows:

```text

```

Click "Execute" and click on the workflow ID that popped up next to the "Execute" button. Gradually, the workflow spins up multiple tasks, which you can see in the "Execution flow" tab.
