# Fm-workflows



In order to complete this lab, you have to get "fm-workflows" , tool that containts additional workers and workflows.
You can get it <a href="https://github.com/FRINXio/fm-workflows">here</a>.

Download it into your **FRINX-Machine folder**. 

Make sure FRINX-machine is running, navigate to `cd /fm-workflows` and execute `./startup.sh`. Imported workflows and tasks will appear in FRINX-Machine UI, right after importing finishes. 
To work with workflows, the docker container with sample-topology is launched with startup. To turn off the docker container, use the command `./teardown.sh`.

Note:
If you use FRINX-machine v1.1 please issue the command
```
git checkout 8a611581b3d8b7f75e3348e4723dbf756c3ea02e #valid for downloaded FRINX-machine v1.1
```
in `fm-workflows` directory to avoid error messages related to later incompatible changes.
