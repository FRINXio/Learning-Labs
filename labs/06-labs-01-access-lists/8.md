## Step 3: Sync from network

In the previous step, you have deleted an access list from your device and committed the change. Now, you will update information in your ODL config database from a device, so you can validate that your access list was deleted.

***In step 3 and step 4 it does not matter whether you are working on a ipv4 or ipv6 access list, configuration stays the same.***

In the Postman application, in the "Collections" tab, you will find "sync from network" POST request right under the "commit" that you used in the previous step.

Press "**Send**" to execute the request.


```
POST

http://{{odl_ip}}:8181/restconf/operations/uniconfig-manager:sync-from-network
```

The body of the request should look similar to the following:

```
{
    "input": {
        "target-nodes": {
            "node": [
                "{{node_id}}"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

Expected Status code: **200 OK**

In the next step, you will replace config with operational config from ODL.
