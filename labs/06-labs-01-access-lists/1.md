# FRINX OpenDaylight & UniConfig - Access Lists

In this lab, you will learn to create, remove and place access-lists on devices using FRINX OpenDaylight (ODL) with UniConfig. You will also learn how to monitor and confirm that access lists were created, removed or placed on the device.

## Objectives

When you have completed this lab, you will be able to:

* Create an IPV4 and IPV6 access lists.
* Delete them.
* Place them on an interface of your device.
* Validate success of every step along the way.

### Completion Time: 60 minutes

## Prerequisites

* This lab assumes general knowledge of using a <a href="https://developer.cisco.com/learning/modules/frinx-learning-labs">ODL and Postman</a>
* This lab assumes the reader understands how access lists function in a working network and have worked with them before.
* Before continuing, you have to <a href="https://developer.cisco.com/learning/modules/frinx-learning-labs">mount</a> a device you want to configure.
* To make your experience using Postman environment better, you can download Postman <a href="https://github.com/FRINXio/Postman/tree/carbon/development/learning_labs/part6">collection and environment</a> specifically made for this lab, in which you will find all the request you will need.



## Step 1: Create access list on a Cisco IOS XRV device via CLI

Once you have completed all prerequisites (see above), you begin with creating an access list in ODL.

This lab is made for IOS XRV devices, so make sure your device matches.

In the Postman application, look at the left column and select the "Collections" tab, look up "Learning_Lab_part6" and use either "create ipv4 access list".

Press "**Send**" to execute the request.



```
PUT

http://{{odl_ip}}:8181/restconf/config/network-topology:network-topology/topology/uniconfig/node/xr5/frinx-uniconfig-topology:configuration/frinx-openconfig-acl:acl/acl-sets/acl-set/inacl1/frinx-openconfig-acl:ACL_IPV4
```


The body of the request will look differently based on rules you want to use in the access list and your postman environment, this is just an example:

```
{
    "acl-set": [
        {
            "name": "inacl1",
            "type": "frinx-openconfig-acl:ACL_IPV4",
            "config": {
                "name": "inacl1",
                "type": "frinx-openconfig-acl:ACL_IPV4"
            },
            "acl-entries": {
                "acl-entry": [
                    {
                        "sequence-id": "10",
                        "config": {
                            "sequence-id": "10"
                        },
                        "ipv4": {
                            "config": {
                                "protocol": "frinx-openconfig-packet-match-types:IP_PROTOCOL",
                                "source-address": "192.168.1.215/24",
                                "destination-address": "192.168.1.214/24"
                            }
                        },
                        "actions": {
                            "config": {
                                "forwarding-action": "frinx-openconfig-acl:DROP"
                            }
                        }
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
Access list is written the same way as if you were traditionally connected to a device and using cli. You can name the access list however you want, using numbered or named way. You can add as many rules as you want. You can make it either standard or extended access list, depending on your needs.

### Creating ipv6 access list works very similarly
Only difference is that you choose "create ipv6 access list" in your postman environment. Post request should look like this:

Press "**Send**" to execute the request.

```
PUT

http://{{odl_ip}}:8181/restconf/config/network-topology:network-topology/topology/uniconfig/node/xr5/frinx-uniconfig-topology:configuration/frinx-openconfig-acl:acl/acl-sets/acl-set/inacl2/frinx-openconfig-acl:ACL_IPV6
```
Press "**Send**" to execute request.

The body of the request will look differently based on rules you want to use in the access list and your postman environment, this is just an example:
```
{
    "frinx-openconfig-acl:acl-set": [
        {
            "type": "frinx-openconfig-acl:ACL_IPV6",
            "name": "inacl2",
            "config": {
                "name": "inacl2",
                "type": "frinx-openconfig-acl:ACL_IPV6"
            },
            "acl-entries": {
                "acl-entry": [
                    {
                        "sequence-id": 2,
                        "ipv6": {
                            "config": {
                                "protocol": "frinx-openconfig-packet-match-types:IP_UDP",
                                "source-address": "::1",
                                "destination-address": "::1"
                            }
                        },
                        "config": {
                            "sequence-id": 2
                        },
                        "actions": {
                            "config": {
                                "forwarding-action": "frinx-openconfig-acl:DROP"
                            }
                        }
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

Expected Status code: **201 Created**

In the next step, you will commit configuration to the device.
