# FRINX OpenDaylight & UniConfig - Access Lists

In this lab, you will learn how to create, remove and place access-lists on devices using FRINX OpenDaylight (ODL) with UniConfig. You will also learn how to monitor and confirm that access lists were created, removed and placed on the device.

## Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

* Create an IPV4 and IPV6 access lists.
* Delete these lists.
* Place them on an interface of your device.
* Validate success of every step along the way.

### Completion Time: 60 minutes

## Prerequisites

* This lab assumes general knowledge of using a <a href="https://developer.cisco.com/learning/modules/frinx-learning-labs">ODL and Postman</a>
* This lab assumes the reader understands how access lists function in a working network and that the reader has some experience working with them.
* Before continuing, you have to <a href="https://developer.cisco.com/learning/modules/frinx-learning-labs">mount</a> a device you want to configure.
* To make your experience using Postman environment better, you can download the Postman <a href="https://github.com/FRINXio/Postman/tree/carbon/development/learning_labs/part6">collection and environment</a>. This collection was made specifically for this lab. In it, you will find all the requests you will need.
* Additional requests that are optional for this lab can be found <a href="https://developer.cisco.com/learning/modules/frinx-learning-labs/01-labs-01-odl-uniconfig-first-steps/step/1">here.</a>  



## Step 1: Create access list on a Cisco IOS XRV device via CLI

Once you have completed all prerequisites (see above), you'll begin with creating an access list in ODL.

This lab is made for IOS XRV devices, so make sure your device matches.

In the Postman application, look at the left column and select the "Collections" tab. Look up "Learning_Lab_part6" and use "create ipv4 access list".

Press "**Send**" to execute the request.



```
PUT

http://{{odl_ip}}:8181/restconf/config/network-topology:network-topology/topology/uniconfig/node/xr5/frinx-uniconfig-topology:configuration/frinx-openconfig-acl:acl/acl-sets/acl-set/inacl1/frinx-openconfig-acl:ACL_IPV4
```


The body of the request will look differently based on rules you want to use in the access list and your postman environment, this is just an example:

```
{
    "acl-set": [
        {
            "name": "inacl1",
            "type": "frinx-openconfig-acl:ACL_IPV4",
            "config": {
                "name": "inacl1",
                "type": "frinx-openconfig-acl:ACL_IPV4"
            },
            "acl-entries": {
                "acl-entry": [
                    {
                        "sequence-id": "10",
                        "config": {
                            "sequence-id": "10"
                        },
                        "ipv4": {
                            "config": {
                                "protocol": "frinx-openconfig-packet-match-types:IP_PROTOCOL",
                                "source-address": "192.168.1.215/24",
                                "destination-address": "192.168.1.214/24"
                            }
                        },
                        "actions": {
                            "config": {
                                "forwarding-action": "frinx-openconfig-acl:DROP"
                            }
                        }
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
The access list is written the same way as if you were connected to a device and using cli. You can name the access list however you want, using the numbered or named way. You can add as many rules as you want. You can make it either a standard or an extended access list, depending on your needs.

### Creating ipv6 access list works very similarly
The only difference is that you choose "create ipv6 access list" in your postman environment. the POST request should look like this:


```
PUT

http://{{odl_ip}}:8181/restconf/config/network-topology:network-topology/topology/uniconfig/node/xr5/frinx-uniconfig-topology:configuration/frinx-openconfig-acl:acl/acl-sets/acl-set/inacl2/frinx-openconfig-acl:ACL_IPV6
```
Press "**Send**" to execute request.

The body of the request will look differently based on rules you want to use in the access list and your postman environment, this is just an example:
```
{
    "frinx-openconfig-acl:acl-set": [
        {
            "type": "frinx-openconfig-acl:ACL_IPV6",
            "name": "inacl2",
            "config": {
                "name": "inacl2",
                "type": "frinx-openconfig-acl:ACL_IPV6"
            },
            "acl-entries": {
                "acl-entry": [
                    {
                        "sequence-id": 2,
                        "ipv6": {
                            "config": {
                                "protocol": "frinx-openconfig-packet-match-types:IP_UDP",
                                "source-address": "::1",
                                "destination-address": "::1"
                            }
                        },
                        "config": {
                            "sequence-id": 2
                        },
                        "actions": {
                            "config": {
                                "forwarding-action": "frinx-openconfig-acl:DROP"
                            }
                        }
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

Expected Status code: **201 Created**

In the next step, you will commit configuration to the device.
