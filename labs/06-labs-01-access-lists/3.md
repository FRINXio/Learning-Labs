## Step 3: Sync from network

In the previous step, you have created an access list on your device and committed the change. Now, you will update information in your ODL config database from a device, so you can validate the successful creation of access list in next steps.

***In step 3 and step 4 it does not matter whether you are working on a ipv4 or ipv6 access list, configuration stays the same.***

In the Postman application, in the "Collections" tab, you will find "sync-from-network" POST request right under the "Create ipv4 access-list" that you used in previous step.

Press "**Send**" to execute the request.


```
POST

http://{{odl_ip}}:8181/restconf/operations/uniconfig-manager:sync-from-network
```

The body of the request should look similar to the following:

```
{
	"input": {
				"target-nodes": {
		}

	}
}
```

Expected Status code: **200 Created**

In the next step, you will replace config with operational config from ODL.
