## Step 2: Commit configuration to the device

Next, you will use a "commit" POST request again.


Press "**Send**" to execute the request.

```
POST

http://{{odl_ip}}:8181/restconf/operations/uniconfig-manager:commit
```


The body of the request should look similar to the following:

```
{
    "input": {
        "target-nodes": {
            "node": [
                "xr5"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

Expected Status code: **200 OK**

The return message will confirm the successful upload of your configuration:

```
{
    "output": {
        "overall-status": "complete",
        "node-results": {
            "node-result": [
                {
                    "node-id": "xr5",
                    "configuration-status": "complete"
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

In the next step, you will create a request that will show if the access list was deleted.
