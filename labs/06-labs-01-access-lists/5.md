## Step 1: Delete access list on a Cisco IOS XRV device via CLI

In the Postman application, look at the left column and select the "Collections" tab, look up "config_enhancements_postman" and under the "Normal case" folder, in "1+2: ipv4 access-list" folder find the "delete ipv4 access-list" POST request.


Press "**Send**" to execute request.

```
POST

http://{{odl_ip}}:8181/restconf/operations/network-topology:network-topology/topology/{{topology_id_cli}}/node/{{node_id}}/yang-ext:mount/cli-unit-generic:execute-and-read
```


The body of the request should look similar to the following:

```
{{
  "input" :
  {
     "ios-cli:command" : "conf t
no ipv4 access-list ***name_of_the_access_list***
commit
end"
  }
}

```

###Deleting ipv6 access list works very similarly
You will use the same post request, but will use different body, that can be found in Postman, in left tab under "3+4 ipv6 access-list"


Body for deleting ipv6 access list should look like this:
```
{
  "input" :
  {
     "ios-cli:command" : "conf t
no ipv6 access-list ***name_of_the_access_list***
commit
end"
  }
}
```




Expected Status code: **200 Created**

In the next step, you will sync configuration of a device and operational configuration of ODL.
