## Step 4: Replace config with operational

In the previous step, you have synced operational config of ODL and device config. In this step, you will replace your local configuration in postman with operational configuration from ODL. With that, you can be sure that all of your configurations are identical.


Press "**Send**" to execute the request.

```
POST

http://{{odl_ip}}:8181/restconf/operations/uniconfig-manager:replace-config-with-operational
```

The body of the request should look similar to the following:

```
{
    "input": {
        "target-nodes": {
            "node": [
                "xr5"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

Expected Status code: **200 OK**

In the next step, you will check access list that you created before.
