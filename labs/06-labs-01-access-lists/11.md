## Step 2: Commit configuration to the device

In the Postman "Collections", in the same folder as before, find the POST request called "commit".


Press "**Send**" to execute the request.

```
POST

http://{{odl_ip}}:8181/restconf/operations/uniconfig-manager:commit
```


The body of the request should look similar to the following:

```
{
    "input": {
        "target-nodes": {
            "node": [
                "xr5"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

Expected Status code: **200 OK**

In the next step, you will create a request that will show you the access list that you just placed on your device.
