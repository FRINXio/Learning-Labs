## Step 2: Commit configuration to the device 

In the Postman "Collections", in same folder as before you will find "delete ingress commit" POST request.


Press "**Send**" to execute request.

```
POST

http://{{odl_ip}}:8181/restconf/operations/uniconfig-manager:commit
```


The body of the request should look similar to the following:

```
{
    "input": {
                "target-nodes": {
        }

    }
}
```

Expected Status code: **200 Created**

In the next step, you will create request that will show you access list that you just placed.
