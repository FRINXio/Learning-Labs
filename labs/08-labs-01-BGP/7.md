## Step 1: Update eBGP on a Cisco IOS XRV device via CLI

In the Postman application, you will find "update bgp - more neighbors, no bgp group" request.

Press "**Send**" to execute the request.

This is example body. You are free to add to it, or remove from it as explained below:

```
{
    "protocol": [
        {
            "name": "{{bgp_process-name}}",
            "identifier": "frinx-openconfig-policy-types:BGP",
            "config": {
                "name": "{{bgp_process-name}}",
                "identifier": "frinx-openconfig-policy-types:BGP"
            },
            "bgp": {
                "global": {
                    "config": {
                        "as": {{bgp_as}}
                    }
                },
                "neighbors": {
                    "neighbor": [
                        {
                            "neighbor-address": "{{ip1}}",
                            "config": {
                                "neighbor-address": "{{ip1}}",
                                "peer-as": {{bgp_peer-as}},
                                "enabled": true
                            }
                        }, 
                        {
                            "neighbor-address": "{{ip2}}",
                            "config": {
                                "neighbor-address": "{{ip2}}",
                                "peer-as": {{bgp_peer-as2}},
                                "enabled": true
                            }
                        }
                    ]   
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
As stated in "creating eBgp.." step, you can edit these fields according to your needs:

In this case however, you will be updating already existing eBgp protocol. In this example you will remove "peer-group" argument, in case you don't need it. You will also add a second neighbor with AS number different from the first one. You can add any number of neighbors that you need. You do this by copying this container:

```
{
                            "neighbor-address": "{{ip1}}",
                            "config": {
                                "neighbor-address": "{{ip1}}",
                                "peer-as": {{bgp_peer-as}},
                                "enabled": true
                            }
                        },
```
Just be careful of the commas, depending on whether another neighbor container comes after it, or doesn't. In case you want the new neighbor to be in a different bgp process, you change the **"{{bgp_process-name}}"** value next to "name" in your environment, and both in "protocol" and in "config" containers.

Expected Status code: **200 or 201 - Created**

In the next step, you will commit this configuration to your device. You can send a dry-run commit before that, as you did in previous labs if you need to.
