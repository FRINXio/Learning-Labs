# FRINX OpenDaylight & UniConfig - eBGP

In this lab, you will learn to create and remove eBGP external gateway routing protocol on XR5 cisco devices using FRINX OpenDaylight (ODL) with UniConfig.

## Objectives

When you have completed this lab, you will be able to:

* Create eBGP routing protocol.
* Delete it.
* Update its properties.
* Monitor whether the protocol is running on a device or not.

### Completion Time: 30 minutes

## Prerequisites

* To make getting through this lab easier, download Postman environment and collection specifically for this lab from <a href="https://github.com/FRINXio/Postman/tree/carbon/development/learning_labs/part8">our github</a>
* This lab assumes general knowledge of using a <a href="https://frinxio.github.io/Learning-Labs/labs/01-labs-01-odl-uniconfig-first-steps/">ODL and Postman</a>
* This lab assumes the reader understands what role do the routing protocols, specifically BGP, play in a working network and have worked with them before.
* Before continuing, you have to <a href="https://frinxio.github.io/Learning-Labs/labs/01-labs-01-odl-uniconfig-first-steps/">mount</a> a device you want to configure.



## Step 1: Create eBGP on a Cisco IOS XRV device via CLI

Once you have completed all the prerequisites (see above), you can move on to creating eBGP.

This lab is made primarily for IOS XRV5 devices, so make sure your device matches.

In the Postman application, look at the left column and select the "Collections" tab, look up "Learning_Lab_part8" where you will find all the requests needed for this lab. For this step, use "configure eBGP" request.

Press "**Send**" to execute the request.

```
PUT

http://{{odl_ip}}:8181/restconf/config/network-topology:network-topology/topology/uniconfig/node/xr5/frinx-uniconfig-topology:configuration/frinx-openconfig-network-instance:network-instances/network-instance/default/protocols/protocol/frinx-openconfig-policy-types:BGP/1
```


The body of the request should look similarily to this:

```
{
    "protocol": [
        {
            "name": "1",
            "identifier": "frinx-openconfig-policy-types:BGP",
            "config": {
                "name": "1",
                "identifier": "frinx-openconfig-policy-types:BGP"
            },
            "bgp": {
                "global": {
                    "config": {
                        "as": "1"
                    }
                },
                "neighbors": {
                    "neighbor": [
                        {
                            "neighbor-address": "192.168.1.215",
                            "config": {
                                "neighbor-address": "192.168.1.215",
                                "peer-group": "nbrgroup1",
                                "peer-as": "65000",
                                "enabled": true
                            }
                        }
                    ]
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
You can edit these fields according to your needs:

In "bgp", you can edit **"as"** field, according to BGP ASN that was probabbly assigned to you by organization depending on your location when you asked for it and provided that you need to utilize eBGP. Or you can use of from the pool made for private use (64512 - 65534).

In "neighbors" you can edit all of the fields. You are also free to add more neighbors if you need to.

**"neighbor_address"** as the name suggests is the ip address of neighbor from another AS. 

**"peer-group"** is a function of BGP that allows you to group BGP neighbors that share the same outbound policies, that allows more efficient update calculations. You are free to remove it, if you don't use this function.

**"peer-as"** is number of AS that is used by neighbor you are adding.


Expected Status code: **201 Created**

In the next step, you will commit this configuration to your device. You can send a dry-run commit before that, as you did in previous labs if you need to.

[>>> Next, head for step 2: Commit the configuration <<<](2.md)
