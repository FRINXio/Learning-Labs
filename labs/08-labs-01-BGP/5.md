## Step 2: Commit the configuration

For this step select "commit" from your "Learning_lab_part8" Postman collection.

Commiting configuration sends it from your environment and odl to your device.

Press "**Send**" to execute the request.

```
POST

http://{{odl_ip}}:8181/restconf/operations/uniconfig-manager:commit
```


The body of the request should look like this:

```
{
    "input": {
        "target-nodes": {
            "node": [
                "xr5"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

Expected Status code: **200 OK**

Return message will confirm successful upload of your configuration:


```
{
    "output": {
        "overall-configuration-status": "complete",
        "node-config-results": {
            "node-config-result": [
                {
                    "nodeId": "xr5",
                    "configuration-status": "complete"
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

In the next step, you will send a show request that will confirm successful creation of eBGP. You may want to use "sync from network" & "replace config with operational" commands as you did in previous labs, it is however optional.
