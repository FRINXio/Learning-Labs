[>>> Head back to step 1: Mount a Cisco IOS XE device via CLI <<<](1.md)  

# Step 2: Check if the device is connected 

In the previous step, you have mounted a Cisco IOS XE device to OpenDaylight. Now, we will check if the device was mounted properly.

In the left column of **Postman** environment, select the "Collections" tab, click on "sample XE collection" and find the "check xe uc status connected" GET request.

Press "**Send**" to execute request.

```
GET
{% raw %}
[http://{{odl_ip}}:8181/restconf/operational/network-topology:network-topology/topology/{{topology_id_cli}}/node/{{node_id}}
{% endraw %}
```

You will see the following output when your device was mounted successfully.

```

[...]

"cli-topology:connection-status": "connected",
"cli-topology:connected-message": "Success",

[...]

```

It may take in the order of 20 seconds to mount the IOS XE device for the first time. Look out for the value of "connection-status":

```
{% raw %}
{

   "node": [
   	{
		"node-id": "xe",
       		"cli-topology:connection-status": "connecting",
       		"cli-topology:connected-message": "Connecting",
       		"cli-topology:default-error-patterns": {
	           	"error-pattern": [
	               	"% Configure the peer-group .+ first",
	               	"(^|\\n)% (?i)invalid input(?-i).*",
	               	"(^|\\n)% (?i)Incomplete command(?-i).*",
	               	"(^|\\n)% (?i)BGP(?-i).*",
	               	"(^|\\n)^\\s+\\^.*",
	               	"(^|\\n)% Topology global(?-i).*"
           				 ]

       	},
       	"cli-topology:default-commit-error-patterns": {}

   	}

   	  ]

}
{% endraw %}
```
Refresh the request until "cli-topology:connection-status" and "cli-topology:connected-message" show the value "Connected". If you are waiting for more than 20 seconds to see the "Connected" status, check if your ODL container or instance can reach the networking device and vice versa. Also make sure you are using the correct credentials and port to connect to the device.  

Expected status code: **200 OK**
