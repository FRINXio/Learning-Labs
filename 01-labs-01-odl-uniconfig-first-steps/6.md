# Step 6: Show all interfaces

After the device was successfully connected, we continue with our next API call to show all interfaces that are currently configured on the device.

Within the interface information we may get for example name, type, subinterfaces, IP address, prefix length, description or device current status.

Following you find the request URI and response from ODL for our sample router. Actual output will depend on the configuration of your device, e.g. number of interfaces and various state of configuration.

In the left column select "Collections" tab, click on "sample XE collection" and find "show all interfaces with loopback" GET request. Requests used in next chapters are listed below.

Press "**Send**" to execute request.

Study the content of request to properly capture the point.

Postman response reads as follows:

The order of interfaces in a response output can vary. Also, take this response output as an example. It may not reflect configuration of your current device.

Expected status code: **200 OK**

Difference between "show all interfaces" and this instance is, that in this case you will see created loopback with IP address on the device.
