# Step 5: UniConfig API call to set IP address

In this section, we configure IP address and mask to the loopback interface that we have created in previous step.

In the left column of the Postman application select the "Collections" tab, click on "sample XE collection" and find the "set ip address on loopback" PUT request.

Press "**Send**" to execute request.

```
{% raw %}
PUT
http://{{odl_ip}}:8181/restconf/config/network-topology:network-topology/topology/uniconfig/node/{{node_id}}/frinx-uniconfig-topology:configuration/frinx-openconfig-interfaces:interfaces/interface/Loopback1
{% endraw %}
```
The body of your request will look similar to the following:

```
{
    "frinx-openconfig-interfaces:interface": [
        {
            "name": "Loopback1",
            "config": {
                "type": "iana-if-type:softwareLoopback",
                "enabled": true,
                "name": "Loopback1"
            },
            "subinterfaces": {
                "subinterface": [
                    {
                        "index": 0,
                        "frinx-openconfig-if-ip:ipv4": {
                            "addresses": {
                                "address": [
                                    {
                                        "ip": "9.9.9.9",
                                        "config": {
                                            "ip": "9.9.9.9",
                                            "prefix-length": 24
                                        }
                                    }
                                ]
                            }
                        }
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

We have now added an IP address to our loopback interface. Changes have only been applied to configuration data store in FRINX ODL and not to the network device itself. We will update the network device with the following commit request.

Expected status code: **200 OK**


# Commit

In the previous step we updated the configuration data store in FRINX ODL. We now have to apply those changes to the network devices. We can apply changes by calling the commit command. The following request shows you how to commit your changes.

In the left column of **Postman** environment, select "Collections" tab, click on "sample XE collection" and find the "commit" POST request.

The following request shows you how to commit your changes. 

```
{% raw %}
POST
http://{{odl_ip}}:8181/restconf/operations/uniconfig-manager:commit
{% endraw %}
```

The body of the request looks like the following:

```
{
	"input": {
            	"target-nodes": {
    	}	}
}
```
The output from FRINX ODL will be similar to the following:

```
{
   "output": {
   	"overall-configuration-status": "complete",
   	"node-config-results": {
       	"node-config-result": [
           	{
               	"nodeId": "xe",
               	"configuration-status": "complete"
           	}
       	]
   	}
   }
}
```

Expected status code: **Status 200 OK**

Both "overall-configuration-status" and "configuration-status" should show the value "complete". If not, the changes have not been committed properly.
