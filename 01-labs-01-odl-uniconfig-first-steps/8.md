# Step 8: Unmount device

Unmounting procedure use practically the same request as mounting does, with a difference in the request method. In mount request you have used PUT method and in case of unmount request you are using DELETE method without body in request.

In the left column select "Collections" tab, click on "sample XE collection" and find "Unmount IOS XE" DELETE request.

Press "**Send**" to execute request.

Study the content of request to properly capture the point. 

```
DELETE

```

Output does not contain any configuration data. The confirmation of successful unmounting of the device can be seen in the status code area.

Expected status code: **200 OK**
