# Step 5: UniConfig API call to set IP address

In this section, we configure IP address and mask to the loopback interface that we have created in previous step.

In the left column select "Collections" tab, click on "sample XE collection" and find "set ip address on loopback" PUT request. Requests used in next chapters are listed below.

Press "**Send**" to execute request.

Study the content of request to properly capture the point. 

Following is the request to ODL:


```
PUT

http://{{odl_ip}}:8181/restconf/config/network-topology:network-topology/topology/uniconfig/node/{{node_id}}/frinx-uniconfig-topology:configuration/frinx-openconfig-interfaces:interfaces/interface/Loopback1

```
Response should look as follows:


```
{
    "frinx-openconfig-interfaces:interface": [
        {
            "name": "Loopback1",
            "config": {
                "type": "iana-if-type:softwareLoopback",
                "enabled": true,
                "name": "Loopback1"
            },
            "subinterfaces": {
                "subinterface": [
                    {
                        "index": 0,
                        "frinx-openconfig-if-ip:ipv4": {
                            "addresses": {
                                "address": [
                                    {
                                        "ip": "9.9.9.9",
                                        "config": {
                                            "ip": "9.9.9.9",
                                            "prefix-length": 24
                                        }
                                    }
                                ]
                            }
                        }
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

We have now added an IP address to our loopback interface. Changes have only been applied to configuration data store and not to the network device itself yet. We will update the network device in the upcoming section.

Expected status code: **200 OK**


# Commit

In previous step we updated the configuration data store. We now have to apply those changes to the network devices. We can apply changes by calling a commit command. The following request shows you how to commit your changes. 

In the left column of **Postman** environment, select "Collections" tab, click on "sample XE collection" and find "commit" POST request.

We can apply the changes by calling a commit command. The following request shows you how to commit your changes. 

```
POST 

http://{{odl_ip}}:8181/restconf/operations/uniconfig-manager:commit

```

The body of the request looks as follows:

```
{
	"input": {
            	"target-nodes": {
    	}	}
}
```
Postman response reads as follows:

```
{
   "output": {
   	"overall-configuration-status": "complete",
   	"node-config-results": {
       	"node-config-result": [
           	{
               	"nodeId": "xe",
               	"configuration-status": "complete"
           	}
       	]
   	}
   }
}
```

Expected status code: **Status 200 OK**

Both "overall-configuration-status" and "configuration-status" should read "complete" in their lines. If not, the changes has not been committed properly.
