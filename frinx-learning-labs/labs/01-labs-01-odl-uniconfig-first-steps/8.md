# Step 8: Unmount device

Unmounting procedure use practically the same request as mounting does, with a difference in the request method. In mount request you have used PUT method and in case of unmount request you are using DELETE method without body in request.

```
DELETE

http://{{odl_ip}}:8181/restconf/config/network-topology:network-topology/topology/{{topology_id_cli}}/node/{{node_id}}

```

The outcome does not contain any configuration data. The confirmation of successful unmounting of the device can be seen in the status code area.

Expected status code: **200 OK**
