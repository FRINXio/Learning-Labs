# Step 7: Execute & Read API call to show interface counters details

In the previous examples we have used OpenConfig semantics to configure and read from our network device. In this section we will show you how you can send and read native commands to and from your network device.  In the following example we use "GigabitEthernet1". Make sure you edit the interface name to match an actual interface on your device.

Request:

```
POST
http://{{odl_ip}}:8181/restconf/operations/network-topology:network-topology/topology/{{topology_id_cli}}/node/{{node_id}}/yang-ext:mount/cli-unit-generic:execute-and-read
```

The body of the request looks as follows:

```
{

 "input" :

 {

	"ios-cli:command" : "show interfaces GigabitEthernet1 controller"

 }

}

```

The typical outcome reads as follows. This outcome is an example, it may not reflect the state of your current configuration:

```
{

   "output": {

   	"output": "GigabitEthernet1 is up, line protocol is up \r\n  Hardware is CSR vNIC, address is d2e7.d463.20d2 (bia d2e7.d463.20d2)\r\n  Internet address is 192.168.1.254/24\r\n  MTU 1500 bytes, BW 1000000 Kbit/sec, DLY 10 usec, \r\n 	reliability 255/255, txload 1/255, rxload 1/255\r\n  Encapsulation ARPA, loopback not set\r\n  Keepalive set (10 sec)\r\n  Full Duplex, 1000Mbps, link type is auto, media type is RJ45\r\n  output flow-control is unsupported, input flow-control is unsupported\r\n  ARP type: ARPA, ARP Timeout 04:00:00\r\n  Last input 00:00:01, output 00:00:45, output hang never\r\n  Last clearing of \"show interface\" counters never\r\n  Input queue: 0/375/0/0 (size/max/drops/flushes); Total output drops: 0\r\n  Queueing strategy: fifo\r\n  Output queue: 0/40 (size/max)\r\n  5 minute input rate 0 bits/sec, 0 packets/sec\r\n  5 minute output rate 0 bits/sec, 0 packets/sec\r\n 	512884 packets input, 96132801 bytes, 0 no buffer\r\n 	Received 0 broadcasts (0 IP multicasts)\r\n 	0 runts, 0 giants, 0 throttles \r\n 	0 input errors, 0 CRC, 0 frame, 0 overrun, 0 ignored\r\n 	0 watchdog, 0 multicast, 0 pause input\r\n 	7087 packets output, 781876 bytes, 0 underruns\r\n 	0 output errors, 0 collisions, 0 interface resets\r\n 	72598 unknown protocol drops\r\n 	0 babbles, 0 late collision, 0 deferred\r\n 	0 lost carrier, 0 no carrier, 0 pause output\r\n 	0 output buffer failures, 0 output buffers swapped out\r\nGigabitEthernet1 - Gi1 is mapped to eth0 on VXE\r\n  DPIF Rx Drop 0 Packets 512935\r\n  Driver Rx Stops 0 DPIF Rx Congestion Drop 0"

Expected status code for both requests: **200 OK**

The output is returned in json format which requires escaping. You need to unescape the text to retrieve the original formatting. (e.g. [https://www.freeformatter.com/json-escape.html](https://www.freeformatter.com/json-escape.html))
