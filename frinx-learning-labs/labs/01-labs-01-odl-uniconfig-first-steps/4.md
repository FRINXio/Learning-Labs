# Step 4: UniConfig API call to create loopback interface 

The following requests show you how to create and in the next step, configure a loopback interface.

In the left column of the **Postman** environment, select "Collections" tab, click on "sample XE collection" and find "create loopback" PUT request.

Press "**Send**" to execute request.

Study the content of request to properly capture the point. 

```
PUT

http://{{odl_ip}}:8181/restconf/config/network-topology:network-topology/topology/uniconfig/node/{{node_id}}/frinx-uniconfig-topology:configuration/frinx-openconfig-interfaces:interfaces/interface/Loopback1
```
The "Body" of response should look as follows:

```
{
    "frinx-openconfig-interfaces:interface": [
        {
            "name": "Loopback1",
            "config": {
                "type": "iana-if-type:softwareLoopback",
                "enabled": true,
                "name": "Loopback1"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

To make the loopback interface active make sure you set "enabled" to "true".

Expected status code: **201 Created**

# Commit 

In previous step we updated the configuration data store. We now have to apply those changes to the network devices. 

In the left column of **Postman** environment, select "Collections" tab, click on "sample XE collection" and find "commit" POST request.

We can now apply changes by calling a commit command. The following request shows you how to commit your changes. 

```
POST
http://{{odl_ip}}:8181/restconf/operations/uniconfig-manager:commit
```

The body of the request should look as follows:

```
{
	"input": {
		    "target-nodes": {
	   }
	}
}
```

The response from ODL should show you the following output if all changes have been applied successfully.

```
{
    "output": {
        "overall-configuration-status": "complete",
        "node-config-results": {
            "node-config-result": [
                {
                    "nodeId": "xe",
                    "configuration-status": "complete"
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}

```

Expected status code: **Status 200 OK**

Both "overall-configuration-status" and "configuration-status" should read "complete" in their lines. If not, changes have not been committed properly.
