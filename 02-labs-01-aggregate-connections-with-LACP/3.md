## Step 2: Provision the LACP service

Now you have application up and running, we can provision the LACP service.

Application lacp_service.py exposes really simple and straightforward REST API.  
To provision new LACP service, issue simple POST request:

```
POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/service/new-service
{
    "node1": {
        "name": "xr5",
        "bundle": "122",
        "ports": [
            "GigabitEthernet0/0/0/1",
            "GigabitEthernet0/0/0/3"
        ]
    },
    "node2": {
        "name": "xr6",
        "bundle": "187",
        "ports": [
            "GigabitEthernet0/0/0/2",
            "GigabitEthernet0/0/0/5"
        ]
    }
}
```

The configuration bundles GigabitEthernet0/0/0/1 and GigabitEthernet0/0/0/3 interfaces into new bundle with id 122 on node1. Similiarly, it bundles GigabitEthernet0/0/0/2 and GigabitEthernet0/0/0/5 into bundle with id 187 on node2.


Application lacp_service.py internally translates this POST request into openconfig uniconfig based configuration, issues several calls to UNICONFIG API and as a result provision the service.
