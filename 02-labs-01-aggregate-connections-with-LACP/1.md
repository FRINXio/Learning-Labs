# Aggregate multiple connections with LACP service

In this lab, you will learn about LACP service. It is an example Python application that is using Frinx uniconfig framework to provision simple LACP service. Purpose of the application is to show potentional users of uniconfig how to use it in an efficient and simple manner.

## Objective

* Understand how LACP service can be used to agregate multiple network connections
* Learn how to use LACP service to agregate several parallel connections into 1 logical connection

### Completion Time: 10 minutes

## Prerequisites

* Install and run the FRINX ODL distribution
* Install and run Postman
* Mount 2 routers via Postman environment

## Step 0: Get to know LACP

Link aggregation addresses two problems with Ethernet connection, which are bandwith limitations and lack of resilience. Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) within IEEE specification provides a method to control bundling of several physical ports together to form a single logical channel. LACP allows a network device to negotiate an automatic bundling of links by sending LACP packets to the peer.

### LACP Features and practical examples

* Maximum number of bundled ports allowed in the port channel: Valid values are usually from 1 to 8.
* LACP packets are sent with multicast group MAC address 01:80:c2:00:00:02 (01-80-c2-00-00-02)
* During LACP detection period
 * LACP packets are transmitted every second
 * Keep alive mechanism for link member: (default: slow = 30s, fast=1s)
* LACP can have the port-channel load-balance mode 
* LACP mode:
 * **active**: Enables LACP unconditionally.
 * **passive**: Enables LACP only when an LACP device is detected. (This is the default state)

### Advantages over static configuration

* **Failover occurs automatically**: When a link fails and there is (for example) a media converter between the devices, a peer system will not perceive any connectivity problems. With static link aggregation, the peer would continue sending traffic down the link causing the connection to fail.

* **Dynamic configuration**: The device can confirm that the configuration at the other end can handle link aggregation. With Static link aggregation, a cabling or configuration mistake could go undetected and cause undesirable network behavior.
