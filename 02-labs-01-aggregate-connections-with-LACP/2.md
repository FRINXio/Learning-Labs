## Step 1: Install and configure LACP service application

LACP service application runs on python 3.6 or higher.  
Go to the application folder directory and execute following command:

```
cd lacp-service
pip install flask frinx_uniconfig-3.1.7.rc16_frinx_SNAPSHOT-py3-none-any.whl
```

After that change ODL address configuration in lacp_service.py.   
Adjust following data according to your setup:

```
configuration.username = 'admin'
configuration.password = 'admin'
configuration.host = 'http://127.0.0.1:8181/restconf'
```

Now you are ready to start the LACP service application

```
export FLASK_APP=lacp_service.py
flask run
```
